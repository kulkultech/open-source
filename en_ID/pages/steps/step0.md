Lastly, we need you to join our community in [Telegram][Telegram]. And then please also join [Discord chat][Discord] then navigate to the `#first-steps` channel.

### Setting up your development environment

We are software engineers use CLI or terminal to do many things, and we encourage you to do so. The terminal will evolve but will be there for foreseeable future. For **Linux** and **Mac** users there is no additional step, they already provide us with terminal utility. However, for **Windows** we suggest install [Git Bash where you can download it here][GitBash] and get installation for Windows operating system.

### Working with Vim

Note: This not required for a non-technical candidate.

One of the simplest but most powerful text editors out there is Vim. If you want to see what Vim can do and how powerful it can be, you can learn more about [Vim here][LearnVim]. Vim is not necessary for this internship, but it is truly helpful when working with Terminal and Git.
