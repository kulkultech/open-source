# Internship

## About our program

Kulkul.tech internship program where you'll learn how modern software development works. This is an unpaid program, but allowance will be granted on a merit-basis. We have an opening for multiple intern positions.

Below are positions that we're looking for

* Software Engineering Intern (Android, Flutter)
* Software Engineering Intern (iOS, Flutter)
* Software Engineering Intern (Frontend, JavaScript)
* Software Engineering Intern (Frontend, Elm)
* Software Engineering Intern (Frontend, WordPress)
* Technical Writing Intern
* Digital Marketing Intern
* Product Design Intern
* Sales Development Representative Intern

We are a tech-based company and software engineering is at the heart of our company. So although some positions are less technical, we expect all aspiring interns to go through the same First Step Process. In the following section, you'll learn how to finish the first step. However, the completion of the first step is not a guarantee to get the positions. As each intern will be exclusively **mentored** by our team **(a mentorship that worth more than $6k)**, only selected aspiring interns will be selected as our intern. 

## Duration and time commitment

NOTE: This is an intensive internship, a dedicated amount of effort, and time are required.

Since mentoring the next generation would take time, we expect our intern to dedicate significant time and effort to the program. The aspiring interns can be accepted to the program if they can work with us for at least 3 months with at least 20 hours per week commitment. This way we hope we can do the best for the interns and interns can have enough time to learn.

## The Big Picture

Welcome to the first steps of becoming a Virtual Intern at Kulkul.tech! After completing these steps, you'll be able to work on Kulkul.tech's project. These first steps are a process to prove that you have learned the foundational skills before you can progress to working on harder projects with larger teams. Consider this to be the interview for the internship. However, please remember that acceptance to the Virtual Intern program is subject to assessment from our recruitment team.

Once accepted, you and your team will work on an assignment, and we’ll switch up the assignments each week. As part of this internship, you will have the opportunity to work with software and languages including [Git][Git], [GitHub][GitHub], [Markdown][Markdown], [Command Line/Terminal Scripts][CLI], [Vim][Vim], [Android][Android], [iOS][iOS], [Flutter][Flutter], [Elm][Elm], and [Docker][Docker].

## Prerequisites

### Required Prerequisites
The following are the required hardware components that will be needed as part of the Virtual Intern placement. Software solutions such as containers (using Docker) are used by the Kulkul.tech team to ensure that the solutions we develop work across computers and locations.

### Hardware requirements

1. Laptop or computer with minimum 8 GB of RAM (There's no requirement for the OS installed)
2. Android device (Optional for Android Development)
  * Memory (RAM): Minimum 2 GB
  * Operating System:
    * Minimum: Android 6 "Marshmallow"
    * Recommended: Android 8 "Oreo"
3. iPhone device (Optional for iOS Development)
  * Operating System:
    * Minimum: OS 13
    * Recommended: OS 14

## The Steps

Social coding is a huge part of any open-source and collaborative project, and [kulkul.tech][Kulkul] is no different. In the following series of steps, you will learn about Markdown and, Docker, Bash, Vim, GitHub, GitHub Issues, and GitHub Pull Requests.

Because these steps are simple, we expect high-quality work, which may take a longer time. We want to see that you are capable of using or learning how to use these tools (writing good GitHub issues, creating pull requests, using Markdown, Docker, etc). These steps may seem easy, but we want you to impress us with good GitHub etiquette and quality Markdown. The bare minimum would be just to passively follow the steps; you should do further reading about tools/language we use so you can further your understanding and relieve confusion if you're unclear about how something works. **Treat these steps as learning opportunities!**. The GitHub and Markdown skills you practice here are very important for both this internship and a future software development career.

The MDwiki has plenty of resources to help you complete the steps. There is a list of useful links at the end of each step. We also created a [FAQ][FAQ] page where you can find the answers to some commonly asked questions. For anything that is not on the FAQ page, Google and Stack Exchange are your friends :)

We also want you to keep us updated a relatively good amount in the [Discord chat][Discord] as you complete these steps. We will ask you to send us messages, links, and screenshots along the First Steps, and we will use this to track your progress, so please do not forget to do so.

A very large part of these steps is finding problems with these steps and this MDwiki, so take note of any issues that you run into or suggestions for improvement while doing these steps.

There is no official deadline to complete these steps, but most candidates who are approved for the internship program finished the steps within 7-8 days. Good luck!

## Step 0 - Introductory steps

Complete the [New Virtual Intern Application form][Apply]. If you have already done this after being invited to join the team then good job, you're all set!

Log into your GitHub account then **stars** the following repositories

- [Ngecilin](https://github.com/kulkultech/ngecilin) - A Browser Extension to shorten any URL with only 2-clicks.
- [tinyurl-client](https://github.com/kulkultech/tinyurl-client) - A Library to use TinyURL API in the Browser.
- [jumpstart-swe](https://github.com/kulkultech/jumpstart-swe) - A project to help aspiring software engineers to thrive. 
 
Then *follows* our core crews on GitHub!

- [empeje][empeje]
- [yuliefas][yuliefas]
- [hudakurniawan][hudakurniawan]
- [Mima-mim][mima]
- [gitandini][gitandini]

In GitHub, we "Stars" organization repositories and "Follow" individuals. Look for the "Stars" button at the top right of the page when you are in a repository. Also, follow each other to see what others in the group are doing.

### Setting up your development environment

We are software engineers use CLI or terminal to do many things, and we encourage you to do so. The terminal will evolve but will be there for foreseeable future. For **Linux** and **Mac** users there is no additional step, they already provide us with terminal utility. However, for **Windows** we suggest install [Git Bash where you can download it here][GitBash] and get installation for Windows operating system.

### Working with Vim

One of the simplest but most powerful text editors out there is Vim. If you want to see what Vim can do and how powerful it can be, you can learn more about [Vim here][LearnVim]. Vim is not necessary for this internship, but it is truly helpful when working with Terminal and Git.
