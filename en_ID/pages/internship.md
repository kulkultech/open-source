# Internship

## About our program

Kulkul.tech internship program where you'll learn how modern software development works. This is an unpaid program, but allowance will be granted on a merit-basis. We have an opening for multiple intern positions.

Below are positions that we're looking for

* Software Engineering Intern (Android, Flutter)
* Software Engineering Intern (iOS, Flutter)
* Software Engineering Intern (Frontend, JavaScript)
* Software Engineering Intern (Frontend, Elm)
* Software Engineering Intern (Frontend, WordPress)
* Technical Writing Intern
* Digital Marketing Intern
* Product Design Intern
* Sales Development Representative Intern

We are a tech-based company and software engineering is at the heart of our company. So although some positions are less technical, we expect all aspiring interns to go through the same First Step Process. In the following section, you'll learn how to finish the first step. However, the completion of the first step is not a guarantee to get the positions. As each intern will be exclusively **mentored** by our team **(a mentorship that worth more than $6k)**, only selected aspiring interns will be selected as our intern.
