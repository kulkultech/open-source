# Internship

## About our program

Kulkul.tech internship program where you'll learn how modern software development works. This is an unpaid program, but allowance will be granted on a merit-basis. We have an opening for multiple intern positions.

Below are positions that we're looking for

* Software Engineering Intern (Android, Flutter)
* Software Engineering Intern (iOS, Flutter)
* Software Engineering Intern (Frontend, JavaScript)
* Software Engineering Intern (Frontend, Elm)
* Software Engineering Intern (Frontend, WordPress)
* Technical Writing Intern
* Digital Marketing Intern
* Product Design Intern
* Sales Development Representative Intern

We are a tech-based company and software engineering is at the heart of our company. So although some positions are less technical, we expect all aspiring interns to go through the same First Step Process. In the following section, you'll learn how to finish the first step. However, the completion of the first step is not a guarantee to get the positions. As each intern will be exclusively **mentored** by our team **(a mentorship that worth more than $6k)**, only selected aspiring interns will be selected as our intern. 

## Duration and time commitment

NOTE: This is an intensive internship, a dedicated amount of effort, and time are required.

Since mentoring the next generation would take time, we expect our intern to dedicate significant time and effort to the program. The aspiring interns can be accepted to the program if they can work with us for at least 3 months with at least 20 hours per week commitment. This way we hope we can do the best for the interns and interns can have enough time to learn.

## The Big Picture

Welcome to the first steps of becoming a Virtual Intern at Kulkul.tech! After completing these steps, you'll be able to work on Kulkul.tech's project. These first steps are a process to prove that you have learned the foundational skills before you can progress to working on harder projects with larger teams. Consider this to be the interview for the internship. However, please remember that acceptance to the Virtual Intern program is subject to assessment from our recruitment team.

Once accepted, you and your team will work on an assignment, and weâ€™ll switch up the assignments each week. As part of this internship, you will have the opportunity to work with software and languages including Git, GitHub, Markdown, Command Line/Terminal Scripts, Vim, Android, iOS, Flutter, Elm, and Docker.
