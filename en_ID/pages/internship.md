# Internship

## About our program

Kulkul.tech internship program where you'll learn how modern software development works. This is an unpaid program, but allowance will be granted on a merit-basis. We have an opening for multiple intern positions.

Below are positions that we're looking for

* Software Engineering Intern (Android, Flutter)
* Software Engineering Intern (iOS, Flutter)
* Software Engineering Intern (Frontend, JavaScript)
* Software Engineering Intern (Frontend, Elm)
* Software Engineering Intern (Frontend, WordPress)
* Technical Writing Intern
* Digital Marketing Intern
* Product Design Intern
* Sales Development Representative Intern

We are a tech-based company and software engineering is at the heart of our company. So although some positions are less technical, we expect all aspiring interns to go through the same First Step Process. In the following section, you'll learn how to finish the first step. However, the completion of the first step is not a guarantee to get the positions. As each intern will be exclusively **mentored** by our team **(a mentorship that worth more than $6k)**, only selected aspiring interns will be selected as our intern. 

## Duration and time commitment

NOTE: This is an intensive internship, a dedicated amount of effort, and time are required.

Since mentoring the next generation would take time, we expect our intern to dedicate significant time and effort to the program. The aspiring interns can be accepted to the program if they can work with us for at least 3 months with at least 20 hours per week commitment. This way we hope we can do the best for the interns and interns can have enough time to learn.

## The Big Picture

Welcome to the first steps of becoming a Virtual Intern at Kulkul.tech! After completing these steps, you'll be able to work on Kulkul.tech's project. These first steps are a process to prove that you have learned the foundational skills before you can progress to working on harder projects with larger teams. Consider this to be the interview for the internship. However, please remember that acceptance to the Virtual Intern program is subject to assessment from our recruitment team.

Once accepted, you and your team will work on an assignment, and weâ€™ll switch up the assignments each week. As part of this internship, you will have the opportunity to work with software and languages including [Git][Git], [GitHub][GitHub], [Markdown][Markdown], [Command Line/Terminal Scripts][CLI], [Vim][Vim], [Android][Android], [iOS][iOS], [Flutter][Flutter], [Elm][Elm], and [Docker][Docker].

## Prerequisites

### Required Prerequisites
The following are the required hardware components that will be needed as part of the Virtual Intern placement. Software solutions such as containers (using Docker) are used by the Kulkul.tech team to ensure that the solutions we develop work across computers and locations.

### Hardware requirements

1. Laptop or computer with minimum 8 GB of RAM (There's no requirement for the OS installed)
2. Android device (Optional for Android Development)
  * Memory (RAM): Minimum 2 GB
  * Operating System:
    * Minimum: Android 6 "Marshmallow"
    * Recommended: Android 8 "Oreo"
3. iPhone device (Optional for iOS Development)
  * Operating System:
    * Minimum: OS 13
    * Recommended: OS 14

## The Steps

Social coding is a huge part of any open-source and collaborative project, and [kulkul.tech][Kulkul] is no different. In the following series of steps, you will learn about Markdown and, Docker, Bash, Vim, GitHub, GitHub Issues, and GitHub Pull Requests.

Because these steps are simple, we expect high-quality work, which may take a longer time. We want to see that you are capable of using or learning how to use these tools (writing good GitHub issues, creating pull requests, using Markdown, Docker, etc). These steps may seem easy, but we want you to impress us with good GitHub etiquette and quality Markdown. The bare minimum would be just to passively follow the steps; you should do further reading about tools/language we use so you can further your understanding and relieve confusion if you're unclear about how something works. **Treat these steps as learning opportunities!**. The GitHub and Markdown skills you practice here are very important for both this internship and a future software development career.

The MDwiki has plenty of resources to help you complete the steps. There is a list of useful links at the end of each step. We also created a [FAQ][FAQ] page where you can find the answers to some commonly asked questions. For anything that is not on the FAQ page, Google and Stack Exchange are your friends :)

We also want you to keep us updated a relatively good amount in the [Discord chat][Discord] as you complete these steps. We will ask you to send us messages, links, and screenshots along the First Steps, and we will use this to track your progress, so please do not forget to do so.

A very large part of these steps is finding problems with these steps and this MDwiki, so take note of any issues that you run into or suggestions for improvement while doing these steps.

There is no official deadline to complete these steps, but most candidates who are approved for the internship program finished the steps within 7-8 days. Good luck!

## Step 0 - Introductory steps

Complete the [New Virtual Intern Application form][Apply]. If you have already done this after being invited to join the team then good job, you're all set!

Log into your GitHub account then **stars** the following repositories

- [Ngecilin][Ngecilin] - A Browser Extension to shorten any URL with only 2-clicks.
- [tinyurl-client](https://github.com/kulkultech/tinyurl-client) - A Library to use TinyURL API in the Browser.
- [jumpstart-swe](https://github.com/kulkultech/jumpstart-swe) - A project to help aspiring software engineers to thrive. 
 
Then *follows* our core crews on GitHub!

- [empeje][empeje]
- [yuliefas][yuliefas]
- [hudakurniawan][hudakurniawan]
- [Mima-mim][mima]
- [gitandini][gitandini]

In GitHub, we "Stars" organization repositories and "Follow" individuals. Look for the "Stars" button at the top right of the page when you are in a repository. Also, follow each other to see what others in the group are doing.

Lastly, we need you to join our community in our [Discord chat][Discord] and then navigate to the `#first-steps` channel.

### Setting up your development environment

We are software engineers use CLI or terminal to do many things, and we encourage you to do so. The terminal will evolve but will be there for foreseeable future. For **Linux** and **Mac** users there is no additional step, they already provide us with terminal utility. However, for **Windows** we suggest install [Git Bash where you can download it here][GitBash] and get installation for Windows operating system.

### Working with Vim

One of the simplest but most powerful text editors out there is Vim. If you want to see what Vim can do and how powerful it can be, you can learn more about [Vim here][LearnVim]. Vim is not necessary for this internship, but it is truly helpful when working with Terminal and Git.

## Step 1 - Install Ngecilin in your computer

The first step is we want you to taste how it's like to grab somebody else's code from the internet from the project that we have in the company. Ngecilin has already good documentation that you can follow in [its repositories][Ngecilin].

## Step 2 - Learn how to use SSH

After you are able to install Ngecilin we will soon start our social coding journey. The goals of this step are the following.

* Learn how SSH encryption works by reading this [article][LearnSSH].
* Add your own SSH public key to GitHub to ease your development. You can learn about this in this [documentation][GH-add-ssh].

## Step 3 - Markdown and Fork Tutorial

Note: At the end of this step you will submit **1 Pull Request**.

To finish this step you can follow the tutorial below.

[![][MarkdownTutorialThumb]][MarkdownTutorial]

## Step 4 - System tutorial and Docker

To finish this step you can follow the tutorial below.

[![][DockerTutorialThumb]][DockerTutorial]

## Step 5 - Keeping fork updated

To finish this step you can follow the tutorial below.

[![][SyncForkThumb]][SyncFork]

## Step 6 - GitHub Issues Tutorial

Note: At the end of this step, you will have the following finished.
--
- **2 pull requests made** (one at step 3 and one at step 6)
- **1 comment added** (on an issue you didn't create)
- **1 issue created**

Follow the GitHub Issues tutorial video below to create at least one issue. Post a link in [Discord][Discord] whenever you create an issue or when you comment on someone else's issue. You are encouraged to post as many issues as you can for improving the page as well as for personal practice. 

No issue is too big or too small to be filed and it is OK if you are not sure how to fix it yourself. If you know how to solve an issue, be sure to provide a detailed account of your research and show how to fix it. It is ok to file an issue about minor typos and very small changes, but do not make this the case for all the issues that you file. You can also work on issues that you didn't create.

Make sure you have created at least one issue, resolved it, commented on an issue you didn't create and have a pull request with the fix merged. You may continue making Issues, Pull requests and Comments, or move on to the next step, while you are waiting for your pull request to be merged. The approval process for your Step 6 fixes may take time, but it is OK to continue working.

## Step 7 - Run another service on top of Docker

To finish this step you can follow the tutorial below.

[![][MySQLDockerThumb]][MySQLDocker]

## Step 8 - Create issues and pull request

Note: At the end of this step, you will have the following finished.
--
- **5 merged pull requests** (one at step 3, one at step 6 and three at step 8)
- **4 comments made** on issues you didn't create (one at step 6 and three at step 8)
- **4 issues created** (one at step 6 and three at step 8)


In this step, we will adopt the motto of "Practice makes Perfect". You will follow the same steps as in Step 6, continuing to improve this Markdown Wiki so that it is educational, yet easy to understand for future interns.

You should:

* **Add comments** to three issues other than your own (somebody else's issue) Create three new issues (in addition to those you have already created in previous steps)
* Get approval to **work on the issues** you have created. Make sure someone from the Kulkul's team confirms that you should work on the issue **BEFORE** you start to work on it. Resolve the three issues by making the necessary changes in your repo with three separate pull requests.

Just as your learning with this Wiki was made possible by the efforts of previous interns, now we turn to you to continue that tradition and help future interns take their First Steps. Through this step, you should try to further improve our Markdown Wiki, with better explanations, formatting fixes, and more!

You must have made your pull requests and have them each approved by at least two other Kulkul.tech team members/interns in order for it to be merged to the upstream repository. Just as before, announce your Pull Request on the [Discord chat][Discord] so other members can review it. You may need to make some additional corrections. Learn by teaching - or editing our teaching tool, in this case!

NOTE: When you are fixing an issue, mention the issue number you are fixing in the title of your pull request and make a new branch for every new issue from the master branch.

## Step 9 - Be part of the team

Next thing is to post a screenshot of your completed progress to the [Discord chat room][Discord]. Currently, there's no automatic way to progress (potential issue and PR you can create!), but you can post the screenshot manually.

Message us ("@/all" and "@rrachman") and ask about adding yourself to the virtual intern list found in `interns.md` and setting up a meeting, so you can become a part of the team as soon as possible if you're considered well suited.
